# Dev Environments

We have learned how to build development environments, but it's a bit tedious to write `flake.nix` for each project.

Luckily, some people in the community have done this for us. The following repository contains development environment templates for most programming languages. Just copy and paste them:

If you think the structure of `flake.nix` is still too complicated and want a simpler way, you can also consider using the following project, which encapsulates Nix more thoroughly and provides users with a simpler definition:
